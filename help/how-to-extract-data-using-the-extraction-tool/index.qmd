title: "How to extract time series environmental variables from eReefs models using the Extraction Tool"
---

If you are interested in environment conditions at a specific research site on the Great Barrier Reef you can use the [eReefs Extraction Tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/?_gl=1*14cmc84*_ga*OTM5OTM3MTMzLjE2NjczNTcwNzg.*_ga_6SSTNBNHXG*MTY5MjE1MDkyOS4zNy4xLjE2OTIxNTQwNTQuMC4wLjA.) to extract time series data for environmental variables and locations of interest from the eReefs models.

With the [eReefs Extraction Tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/?_gl=1*14cmc84*_ga*OTM5OTM3MTMzLjE2NjczNTcwNzg.*_ga_6SSTNBNHXG*MTY5MjE1MDkyOS4zNy4xLjE2OTIxNTQwNTQuMC4wLjA.) you can

- upload a set of locations (latitute/longitude pairs)
- choose the data model and variables
- select the start and end time and a the time step
- and select the depths

The data is extracted from the input files and aggregated into a CSV file which can be downloaded for further use.

For more information see the [eReefs Extraction Tool FAQs](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/faqs?_gl=1*14cmc84*_ga*OTM5OTM3MTMzLjE2NjczNTcwNzg.*_ga_6SSTNBNHXG*MTY5MjE1MDkyOS4zNy4xLjE2OTIxNTQwNTQuMC4wLjA.).
