## Source data

The videos/images on this page are based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model (v2.0)](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/) of the
Great Barrier Reef. The raw data is available from [NCI THREDDS server](https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fx3/gbr1_2.0/catalog.html) (hourly) and the
aggregate data from the [AIMS eReefs THREDDS server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html) (daily, monthly, yearly and overall). These
map layers are also available for inspection in the [eReefs Data Explorer](https://portal.ereefs.info/).
