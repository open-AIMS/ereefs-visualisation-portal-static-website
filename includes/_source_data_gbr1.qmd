## Source data

The videos/images on this page are based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model (v2.0)](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/) of the 
Great Barrier Reef. The raw data is available from [NCI THREDDS server](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fx3/gbr1_2.0/catalog.html) (hourly) and the 
aggregate data from the [AIMS eAtlas THREDDS server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html) (daily, monthly, yearly, all). These 
map layers are also available for inspection as an [interactive map](https://maps.eatlas.org.au/atlasmapper/client/ereefs/index.html).
