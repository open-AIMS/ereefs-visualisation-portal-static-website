    "section": "",
    "text": "OPeNDAP stands for \"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol\" (see https://www.opendap.org/about) and can be used to access remote NetCDF files. The AIMS eReefs THREDDS server provides access via OPeNDAP for all NetCDF files produced by the AIMS eReefs system. In this tutorial we will use ArcMap to render the data, but you can also have a look at our tutorials How to plot AIMS eReefs data with R and How to plot AIMS eReefs data with Python for a more programatically approach. More clients can be found on the OPeNDAP clients website.\nShould I download the NetCDF files or use OPeNDAP to access the data?\nThe answer to this question depends mainly on the use-case. In general, the use of OPeNDAP is slower and more un-responsive but it is a good way to explore the data before downloading it (NetCDF files can be very large, sometimes multiple GB). When you exactly know which file(s) you need, it is recommended to download the file(s) (see How to open a NetCDF file with ArcMap and QGIS) as this will make working with the file(s) faster.\n\n\n\nOpen the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server website and select the link Data derived from the eReefs model.\nOn the next page select the link to the required model\n\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3P_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Pre-Industrial catchment conditions\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3R_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Hindcast catchment conditions (anthropogenic loads reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022)\nGBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) - source catchments using Baseline catchment conditions.\ngbr1_2.0 := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (1 km resolution)\ngbr4_v2 := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\nEach model has its derived output grouped into folders with the names indicating the time steps and aggregation in a file. For example a folder with the name\"daily-monthly\" contains \"monthly\" files with \"daily\" data while a folder with the name \"annual-annual\" contains \"annual\" files with \"annual\" data. Select the link to the folder of interest.\nIn the list of NetCDF files, select the one of interest. The file names describe the data they contain with the structure \"EREEFS_organisations_model_timestep-aggregation-date.nc\". For example the file \"EREEFS_AIMS-CSIRO_gbr4_v2_hydro_daily-monthly-2010-09.nc\" can be broken down into:\n\"AIMS-CSIRO\" := Reference to the organisations AIMS and CSIRO\n\"gbr4_v2_hydro\" := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)\n\"daily\" := \"daily\" data\n\"monthly\" := one month of data\n\"2010-09\" := data for September 2010\nOn the single file page in the section \"Access\" click the link \"OPENDAP\"\nOn the next page copy the value of the input field \"Data URL\".

    "text": "The eReefs model data is produced by CSIRO and published on the NCI THREDDS server (see section Download eReefs model data from NCI THREDDS server). For the visualisations on this portal, the AIMS eReefs system downloads, processes and aggregates the raw eReefs model data to provide multiple time steps (e.g. monthly, yearly) and to transform the data from a curvilinear to a rectilinear grid. While the curvilinear grid in the raw eReefs model data is better suited to the modelling and execution requirements, it can be cumbersome to process with typical data science tools. Therefore, all eReefs derived datasets generated by the AIMS eReefs system are regridded to a rectilinear grid.\nAll derived data produced by the AIMS eReefs system can be found on the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server.

The “Baseline scenario” panel shows the best estimate for light intensity above seagrass at noon for the time period from December 2010 to April 2019.\nThe “Pre-industrial” panel shows the difference between the baseline scenario and pre-industrial conditions. Areas in blue correspond to locations where the pre-industrial values are estimated to be better than the current baseline (more light intensity above seagrass in the pre-industrial past). Red areas correspond to areas where the pre-industrial conditions would have been worse (lower light intensity above seagrass) than the current baseline. As this plot compares the current conditions with estimated pre-industrial conditions the difference represents the anthropogenic influence on the light intensity above seagrass on the GBR. It shows that current levels in the marine environment are lower than pre-industrial conditions along most of the coastline but specifically in the central and southern sections of the GBR.\nThe “WQIP-Targets” panel shows the effects of the planned targets if they were achieved. The blue area indicates the possible increase of light intensity relative to the current baseline. Red areas correspond to a possible decrease of light intensity relative to the current baseline. The comparison between the baseline and reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario shows that for most places along the coast implementing the WQIP-Target measures would be beneficial as it would increase the light intensity above seagrass, especially in the central and southern sections.\nThe “% River water in sea water” panel shows the total percentage of river water in sea water. It can be used to identify significant river discharges and flood plumes which can have a big impact on the light intensity above seagrass.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Brodie et al. conducted a study utilising the eReefs 4 km coupled hydrodynamic - biogeochemical model and two GBR Dynamic SedNet catchment model scenarios to analyse the water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Brodie et al., 2017). The complex eReefs biogeochemical model allowed for the resolution of biogeochemical processes affecting water quality changes. The main objective was to identify specific load reduction targets for different basins within the GBR, aiming to minimize ecological impacts related to chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations, as well as bottom light thresholds.\nIn 2020 Baird et al. built upon the previous study and expanded it by extending the time period from 2011–2014 to 2011–2018 and analysing the water quality response of a new set of catchment loads scenarios (Baird et al., 2021). These new scenario runs used the updated eReefs coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model with the model configuration GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3x_Dhnd. H2p0 is the configuration of the hydrodynamic model and has been operational since 2016. B3p1 is the configuration of the biogeochemical model, described in Baird et al. (2020). Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state. It uses the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (P2R) GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019) and Empirical SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses a configuration to simulate pre-industrial conditions and shows the change in water quality measures from the removal of all anthropogenic loads. P2R GBR Dynamic SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019), Empirical SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition (q3b) with anthropogenic loads (q3b - q3p) reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) 2017–2022 as calculated in Brodie et al. (2017). Further, the reductions are adjusted to account for the cumulative reductions already achieved between 2014 and 2019 that will be reflected in the 2019 catchment condition used in q3b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable EpiPAR_sg represents the light intensity above seagrass measured in daily light integral (mol photons per square meter per day). Please note that the eReefs BGC model is using a 4km resolution and is developed for large-scale predictions.\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference of daily light intensity above seagrass in mol photons per square meter between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.\nEpiPAR_sg_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) EpiPAR_sg - baseline (q3b) EpiPAR_sg\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference of daily light intensity above seagrass in mol photons per square meter between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.\nEpiPAR_sg_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) EpiPAR_sg - baseline (q3b) EpiPAR_sg\n\n\n\nThe GBR4 river tracer model output represents the river water concentration in sea water for the major rivers along the Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The “all_rivers” product aggregates the output for each river into one variable to represent the total concentration of river water in the sea water.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at any given location, associated with each river.\nThe lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant reduction in light.\nSee Flood plume extents for major rivers on GBR based on modelled river tracers for more information.\n\n\n\n\nBrodie, J., Baird, M., Mongin, M., Skerratt, J., Robillot, C., Waterhouse, J., 2017.

The model estimates the optical properties of the water based on the sediment and nutrients in the water. These all affect the scattering and absorption of light as it passes through the water allowing the model to estimate the attenuation of the light through the water. The Secchi depth is calculated from the vertical integral of attenuation of light at 488nm.\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference of Secchi depths in meter between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario.

    "text": "These maps compare the estimated current state of the GBR (baseline) with pre-industrial and water quality target conditions (see eReefs BGC Scenarios for more information). The “Baseline scenario” panel shows the best estimate for Secchi depth for the time period from December 2010 to April 2019.\nThe “Pre-industrial” panel shows the difference between the baseline scenario and pre-industrial conditions. Areas in blue correspond to locations where the pre-industrial values are estimated to be better than the current baseline (higher Secchi depth in the pre-industrial past). Red areas correspond to areas where the pre-industrial conditions would have been worse (lower Secchi depth) than the current baseline. As this plot compares the current conditions with estimated pre-industrial conditions the difference represents the anthropogenic influence on Secchi depth on the GBR. It shows that current Secchi depth levels in the marine environment are lower than pre-industrial conditions along most of the coastline but most significantly in the central section of the GBR.\nThe “WQIP-Targets” panel shows the effects of the planned targets if they were achieved. The blue area indicates the possible increase in Secchi depth relative to the current baseline. Red areas correspond to a possible decrease in Secchi depth relative to the current baseline. The comparison between the baseline and reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario shows that implementing the WQIP-Target measures would be beneficial as it would increase the Secchi depth in most parts of the GBR but specifically in the southern section.\nThe “% River water in sea water” panel shows the total percentage of river water in sea water. It can be used to identify significant river discharges and flood plumes which can have a big impact on the Secchi depth concentration."

    "text": "In 2016, Brodie et al. conducted a study utilising the eReefs 4 km coupled hydrodynamic - biogeochemical model and two GBR Dynamic SedNet catchment model scenarios to analyse the water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Brodie et al., 2017). The complex eReefs biogeochemical model allowed for the resolution of biogeochemical processes affecting water quality changes. The main objective was to identify specific load reduction targets for different basins within the GBR, aiming to minimize ecological impacts related to chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations, as well as bottom light thresholds.\nIn 2020 Baird et al. built upon the previous study and expanded it by extending the time period from 2011–2014 to 2011–2018 and analysing the water quality response of a new set of catchment loads scenarios (Baird et al., 2021). These new scenario runs used the updated eReefs coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model with the model configuration GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3x_Dhnd. H2p0 is the configuration of the hydrodynamic model and has been operational since 2016. B3p1 is the configuration of the biogeochemical model, described in Baird et al. (2020). Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state. It uses the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (P2R) GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019) and Empirical SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses a configuration to simulate pre-industrial conditions and shows the change in water quality measures from the removal of all anthropogenic loads. P2R GBR Dynamic SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019), Empirical SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition (q3b) with anthropogenic loads (q3b - q3p) reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) 2017–2022 as calculated in Brodie et al. (2017). Further, the reductions are adjusted to account for the cumulative reductions already achieved between 2014 and 2019 that will be reflected in the 2019 catchment condition used in q3b."

    "text": "Secchi depth is an estimate of water clarity, which is traditionally measured by lowering a secchi disk into the water until the disk can not be seen. The model estimates the optical properties of the water based on the sediment and nutrients in the water. These all affect the scattering and absorption of light as it passes through the water allowing the model to estimate the attenuation of the light through the water. The Secchi depth is calculated from the vertical integral of attenuation of light at 488nm.\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference of Secchi depths in meter between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.\nSecchi_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) Secchi - baseline (q3b) Secchi\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference Secchi depths in meter between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.\nSecchi_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) Secchi - baseline (q3b) Secchi\n\n\n\nThe GBR4 river tracer model output represents the river water concentration in sea water for the major rivers along the Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The “all_rivers” product aggregates the output for each river into one variable to represent the total concentration of river water in the sea water.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at any given location, associated with each river.\nThe lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant reduction in light.\nSee Flood plume extents for major rivers on GBR based on modelled river tracers for more information."

The sediment model contains inorganic particles of different size (Dust, Mud, Sand and Gravel) and different mineralogies (carbonate and non-carbonate). The critical shear stress for resuspension, and the sinking rates, are generally larger for large particles, while and mineralogy only affects the optical properties.

To help overcome this limitation the CSIRO eReefs BGC model simulates the light transport through the water based on the nutrients, plankton and suspended sediments. It uses this information to simulate what the ocean would look like if it were imaged by the NASA MODIS satellite. This allows the model results to be directly compared with satellite imagery to check its performance and skill.\nThis visualisation shows the estimated colour image as would be seen by the MODIS satellite, except with no clouds. While we don’t create a direct comparison with the MODIS imagery here on this site, you can view the MODIS imagery via the NASA WorldView browser.\n\n\nThe videos/images on this page are based on the 4km eReefs BioGeoChemical model (v3.1) (GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd) run with SOURCE Catchments using Baseline catchment conditions.

Seagrass and macroalgae play a key role in the nitrogen cycle of inshore areas. When they grow they take up nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon from the water into their leaf and root structures. When they die they break down and release these nutrient stores back into the water column.\nSeagrasses are represented in the model as an amount per m2 with a constant stoichiometry (C:N:P = 550:30:1) for both above-ground, and belowground, biomass, and can translocate organic matter at this constant stoichiometry between the two stores of biomass. Growth occurs only in the above-ground biomass, but losses (grazing, decay etc.) occur in both. Multiple seagrass varieties are represented. The varieties are modelled using the same equations for growth, respiration and mortality, but with different parameter values.\nThe model parameters for each of the three types of seagrass are shown in Table 24 (pg 48) of Baird et al. (2019).\nDetails about about the macroalgae model are detailed in section 4.2 of Baird et al. (2019).\n\n\nThese maps show model derived estimates of density for seagrass and macroalgae. They are not derived from direct observations. Observed seagrass distributions can be found from the dataset: Seagrass mapping synthesis: A resource for coastal management in the Great Barrier Reef (NESP TWQ Project 3.2.1 and 5.4, TropWATER, James Cook University).\nThe BGC model assumes that morality of macroalgae has a constant rate (see section 4.2.4 of Baird et al. (2019)) and so macroalgae dynamics are not affected by environmental factors such as cyclones.\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrogen biomass per m2 of macroalgae. Macroalgae (or seaweed) grows above all other benthic plants (corals, seagrasses, benthic microalgae). It is parameterised as a non-calcifying leafy algae, with a C:N:P ratio of 550:30:1, and a formulation for calculating the percentage of the bottom covered as 1-exp(-ΩMA MA). In the model, in the absence of both calcifying macroalgae (particularly Halimeda) and unicellular epiphytes, macroalgae represents the biomass of all seaweeds and epiphytes. Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrogen biomass per m2 of a seagrass form parameterised to be similar to Zostera. This form captures light after it has passed through macroalgae and before it passes through Halophila. This form is better adapted to high light, low nutrient conditions than Halophila as a result of a deeper root structure and being able to shade it. See macroalgae for elemental ratio and bottom cover. Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrogen biomass per m2 of a seagrass form parameterised to be similar to Halophila. This form captures light after it has passed through the Zostera seagrass form. The Halophila form is better adapted to low light conditions than Zostera, having a faster growth rate and lower minimum light requirement. See macroalgae for elemental ratio and bottom cover. Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrogen biomass per m2 of a seagrass form parameterised to be similar to Halophila deciphens.

For the ocean current data we use the IMOS - OceanCurrent - Gridded sea level anomaly - Near real time dataset and for the temperature the IMOS - SRS - SST - L3S - Single Sensor - 6 day - night time - Australia dataset. The 6 day period was chosen to reduce the chances of data gaps because of cloud coverage.\nThe comparison has some limitations that need to be considered. The IMOS satellite temperature data is created by layering the most recent readings over a 6-day period. This aggregation period helps to fill in areas that are covered by clouds in any one day. This does mean however that in some parts of the map the temperature can be up to 6 days old. The eReefs model will, however, always show a full map from a single day. Furthermore, the IMOS product estimates the temperature from nighttime readings while the eReefs temperature data is a 24-hour average (derived from hourly data). The eReefs ocean current data is also a 24-hour average. This reduces the tidal effects on the current vector, but doesn’t eliminate it, whereas the geostrophic velocities in the IMOS dataset are detided (see the metadata record for more information)."

We will provide further updates when available.\n\n\n\nThis page shows as estimate of exposure to fresh water on the Great Barrier Reef based on the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model.\n\n\nWhen corals are stressed by changes in conditions (such as salinity or temperature), they can expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues (zooxanthellae), causing them to turn completely white (bleach). Prolonged or frequent bleaching events can result in coral death. This product aims to provide an estimate of exposure to fresh water over the aggregation period (eg: a calendar month). Predicting the level of coral bleaching from freshwater exposure is difficult due to uncertainties in the hydrodynamic modelling and the relatively poor understanding of freshwater exposure. This product calculates fresh water exposure as the number of hours over the aggregation period when salinity is below an environmentally significant threshold (26 and 28 PSU are used in the above images, which represent significantly more fresh than sea water). Based on the few observations available, areas in these maps with an exposure of greater than 50 PSU days (such as occurred around North Queensland Floods in 2019) are likely to have experienced coral mortality. In years where there has been minimal flooding the fresh water exposure map is largely blank.\n\n\n\n\nAnimation of salinity at multiple depths 1 km model (scaled to show detail below 32 PSU) (1 km eReefs model)\nAnimation of the full extent of the flood plume 1 km model (salinity scaled to show any fresh water)\nAnimation of the full extent of the flood plume 4 km model (salinity scaled to show any fresh water)\n\n\n\n\nThe salinity of normal ocean water is approximately 35 PSU. As freshwater is mixed with the sea water the salinity drops, with pure water having a PSU of zero. Coral reefs are sensitive to freshwater as exposure can lead to bleaching and death. The relationship between freshwater exposure and coral bleaching and mortality is poorly understood. However flooding from Fitzroy river in 2011 cause significant shallow water coral mortality on the nearby Keppel Islands (Berkelmans et al. 2012).\n\n\n\nThe third panel in the map shows the average salinity for the month. This is quite similar to the freshwater exposure except that is includes contributions from areas where there was very little freshwater.\n\n\n\nThe freshwater exposure maps show the level of exposure to salinity levels below a specified threshold over a month. In the maps above the freshwater exposure was calculated for two threshold levels: 26 and 28 PSU. These were chosen as different species have different tolerances to freshwater exposure, and the most appropriate level is not currently known.\nThe freshwater exposure is calculated from the sum of the daily average salinity below the exposure threshold. Salinity levels above the threshold don't contribute at all to the exposure. Salinity levels below the threshold contribute in proportion to the amount below the threshold. As a result with a threshold of 28 PSU and an exposure to 22 PSU for 3 days the freshwater exposure would be (28-22)*3 = 18 PSU days. The same exposure at 25 PSU would take 6 days (28-25)*6 = 18 PSU days. This method of calculating exposure is conceptually very similar to temperature exposure measured in Degree Heating Weeks, where the higher the temperature is above the typical maximum summer temperature the faster the heat stress occurs. For freshwater exposure the stress occurs when the salinity drops below the threshold value. The lower the salinity the faster the exposure accumulates. More research is needed to determine if this is the best method for estimating stress from freshwater.\nFor comparison the freshwater exposure calculations were applied to the observations taken during the Fitzroy flooding event in 2011 that caused significant coral mortality on reef flats corals in the Keppel Islands (Berkelmans et al. 2012). This shows that exposure to greater than 50 PSU days can result in significant mortality, particularly in sensitive coral species.\n\n\nFreshwater exposure calculated from measurements taken on the Keppel Islands during the 2011 flooding.

It is difficult to reliably determine the level of error without direct measures of salinity during the event, however there are a few clues that give us some estimate of the error and confidence in the results. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the freshwater exposure calculated from the 1 km and 4 km eReefs hydrodynamic models (v2.0). This shows there is a significant difference between these models. For a threshold of 28 PSU at Magnetic Island the 1 km model shows freshwater exposure of 35 PSU days, where as the 4 km model shows 0 PSU days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Freshwater exposure eReefs model comparison by AIMS\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows a comparison between the freshwater exposure  calculated for February 2019 from the 4 km and 1 km eReefs hydrodynamic model (v2.0) with a threshold of 28 PSU. The 4 km model predicts a smaller freshwater plume.\n Observations taken along the eastern side of Magnetic Island taken on the 20th February 2019 showed no evidence of freshwater bleaching, although some corals were pale due to low light conditions. Corals on the rocks near AIMS (near the Haughton river) showed freshwater mortality. These two points of reference can be used to gauge whether the 1 km or 4 km results are more accurate.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n1 km model (28 PSU threshold)\n\n\n4 km model (28 PSU threshold)\n\n\nObserved freshwater mortality\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater exposure (PSU days)\n\n\nPredicted morality (Berkelmans, 2012)\n\n\n4 km model freshwater exposure (28 PSU threshold)\n\n\nPredicted morality (Berkelmans, 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Island\n\n\n35\n\n\nNone\n\n\n0\n\n\nNone\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nCape Ferguson\n\n\n75\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n15\n\n\nNone\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nApplying the previously estimated freshwater exposure 50 PSU days the 1 km model predicts there would be coral mortality at Cape Ferguson, which was the case, where as the 4 km model predicts none.

Coral reefs are sensitive to freshwater as exposure can lead to bleaching and death. The relationship between freshwater exposure and coral bleaching and mortality is poorly understood.

    "text": "The freshwater exposure maps show the level of exposure to salinity levels below a specified threshold over a month. In the maps above the freshwater exposure was calculated for two threshold levels: 26 and 28 PSU. These were chosen as different species have different tolerances to freshwater exposure, and the most appropriate level is not currently known.\nThe freshwater exposure is calculated from the sum of the daily average salinity below the exposure threshold. Salinity levels above the threshold don't contribute at all to the exposure. Salinity levels below the threshold contribute in proportion to the amount below the threshold. As a result with a threshold of 28 PSU and an exposure to 22 PSU for 3 days the freshwater exposure would be (28-22)*3 = 18 PSU days. The same exposure at 25 PSU would take 6 days (28-25)*6 = 18 PSU days. This method of calculating exposure is conceptually very similar to temperature exposure measured in Degree Heating Weeks, where the higher the temperature is above the typical maximum summer temperature the faster the heat stress occurs. For freshwater exposure the stress occurs when the salinity drops below the threshold value. The lower the salinity the faster the exposure accumulates. More research is needed to determine if this is the best method for estimating stress from freshwater.\nFor comparison the freshwater exposure calculations were applied to the observations taken during the Fitzroy flooding event in 2011 that caused significant coral mortality on reef flats corals in the Keppel Islands (Berkelmans et al. 2012). This shows that exposure to greater than 50 PSU days can result in significant mortality, particularly in sensitive coral species.\n\n\nFreshwater exposure calculated from measurements taken on the Keppel Islands during the 2011 flooding.

These floods have damaged the real-time river temperature and flow sensors across surrounding catchments, and Queensland government is working to recover and restore these as quickly as possible. We will provide further updates when available.\n\n\n\nThis page shows the temperature, wind, salinity and ocean currents on the Great Barrier Reef based on the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model. The combination of temperature, wind, salinity and current shows key hydrodynamic parameters of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nThe temperature is primarily driven by the seasons and mixing of the water by wind and ocean currents. If the temperature rises too high during summer months then it can cause corals to bleach. This can be see during the summer months of 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nWind is a key driver of surface water currents, mixing and waves. In winter months the wind typically blows north west. These winds are known as the trade winds as they are a predictable seasonal pattern. In summer months the winds typically drop (except for cyclones) reducing the cooling and mixing of the water, resulting in significant surface temperatures rises during the day, creating a “heart-beat” pattern in the temperature in the video (see the Temperature panel in the March 2017 video as an example). The wind also drives the direction of the flood plumes. The north west blowing trade winds typically push any flood plumes back onto the coast and northwards. When the wind occasionally blows offshore then the plumes are pushed further out.\nThe path of cyclones can be seen in the wind variable. This shows the asymmetrical shape of the cyclone as it approaches the coast, due to the friction of the land slowing the winds on the southern side of the cyclone.\n\n\n\nSalinity is a measure of the saltiness of the water. Fresh water outflow from the rivers caused by flooding and rain events lowers the salinity (appearing as red in the maps). The low salinity is a good approximation for where flood plume waters might be. During flood plumes if the wind is blowing offshore then it will push the plume off the coast more toward the reefs. 2011 was a particularly wet year during the summer months causing extensive plumes to drift over reefal areas. (See Feb 2011 Burdekin region salinity panel for runoff from major flooding).\nNote: In flood plumes nutrient and sediment runoff lead to the formation of green plume water which has small suspended particles coated in algae that travel much further then is predicted by looking at just the lowering of the salinity.\n\n\n\nThe ocean currents are driven by the wind, tides, and temperature and salinity gradients. In the visualisations the strength of the current is represented by colour and the arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data (as shown in the videos) it is possible to see the tidal currents causing the direction of the current to flip back and forth. This tidal current increases the mixing of the water causing sediment in inshore areas to be stirred up. In the daily and monthly visualisations most of the fluctuations of the tidal currents are averaged out, allowing some of the large scale current flow patterns to be seen.\nMany marine organisms (such as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and corals) are dispersed by ocean currents planktonic larvae that float from reef to reef.\n\n\n\n\nCyclones: Nathan (March 2015), Debbi (March 2017),\nCoral bleaching from high temperature (March 2016, March 2017),\nFlood plumes with low salinity (Feb 2019)\nStrong East Australian Current (Nov 2015, monthly average current)\n\n\n\n\nThe videos/images on this page are based on the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model (v2.0) of the Great Barrier Reef.

For the ocean current data we use the IMOS - OceanCurrent - Gridded sea level anomaly - Near real time dataset and for the temperature the IMOS - SRS - SST - L3S - Single Sensor - 6 day - night time - Australia dataset. The 6 day period was chosen to reduce the chances of data gaps because of cloud coverage.\nThe comparison has some limitations that need to be considered. The IMOS satellite temperature data is created by layering the most recent readings over a 6-day period. This aggregation period helps to fill in areas that are covered by clouds in any one day. This does mean however that in some parts of the map the temperature can be up to 6 days old. The eReefs model will, however, always show a full map from a single day. Furthermore, the IMOS product estimates the temperature from nighttime readings while the eReefs temperature data is a 24-hour average (derived from hourly data). The eReefs ocean current data is also a 24-hour average. This reduces the tidal effects on the current vector, but doesn’t eliminate it, whereas the geostrophic velocities in the IMOS dataset are detided (see the metadata record for more information)."

The hydrodynamic model and visualisations are normally updated in near-real time, within 1 week of the current date.\nNote: The eReefs models are currently not being run in near-real time by CSIRO as a result this site only shows the back catalogue up to mid 2020. Near realtime results are expected to be back in operation by the end of 2020.\n\n\n4 km model - v4.0 (Sep 2010 - Nov 2022)\n\nWater movement and physical characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature, wind, salinity and current\nTemperature at 1.5m, 18m and 49m depth\nCurrent at 1.5m, 18m and 103m depth\nTemperature range at 1.5m\nComparing eReefs (GBR4 v4.0 temperature, current) to IMOS satellite temperature and ocean current\n\n\n\n\n4 km model - v2.0 (Nov 2022 - Dec 2023)\n\nWater movement and physical characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature, wind, salinity and current\nTemperature at 1.5m, 18m and 49m depth\nCurrent at 1.5m, 18m and 103m depth\nTemperature range at 1.5m\nComparing eReefs (GBR4 v2.0 temperature, current) to IMOS satellite temperature and ocean current\n\n\n\n\n1 km model (Dec 2014 - present)\n\nWater movement and physical characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature, wind, salinity and current\nTemperature at 2.35m, 18m and 49m depth\nCurrent at 2.35m, 18m and 103m depth\nSalinity at 2.35m, 5.35m and 18m depth\nFresh water exposure at 2.35m\nCurrent magnitude average at 2.35m\nTemperature range at 2.35m\nFlood plume extents for major rivers on GBR based on modelled river tracers"

    "text": "eReefs CSIRO BioGeoChemical model (4 km)\nThe GBR4 BioGeoChemical (GBR) model builds on the GBR4 hydrodynamic model by modelling the water quality (nutrients and suspended sediment) and key ecological processes (coral, seagrass, plankton) that drive the water chemistry. This model allows us to better understand how water quality is affected by land runoff. Detailed information about the model can be found in the paper: CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS): Scientific description of the optical and biogeochemical models (vB3p0).\nThe visualisations on this site are based on version 3.1 of the BioGeoChemical (BGC) model with the baseline conditions. Version 3.1 of the BGC was developed to compare the effects of land practice improvements on water quality changes in the Great Barrier Reef. It was run with three scenarios of river sediment and nutrient loads to simulate the differences between baseline conditions (based on current land use practices in 2019), pre-industrial catchment conditions, and target catchment conditions (anthropogenic loads reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022). This site currently only visualises the baseline scenario run of the model, however data is available for the other scenarios via the NCI THREDDS service (raw model data in curvilinear NetCDF format), the AIMS Data Extraction tool (time series extraction in CSV format) and regridded and aggregated format via the AIMS eReefs THREDDS service.\nA technical assessment of the skill level of the BGC version 3.1 model shows that the absolute accuracy of the BGC model varies significantly with variable and location. A older analysis on the BGC version 2.0 (Skerratt et al., 2018) provides additional background on the skill of the BGC model. As a result care should be taken to ensure the model is fit-for-purpose and in general BGC results should used in combination with second sources of information for making recommendations.\n\n\nWater chemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal alkalinity, PH & Aragonite saturation state\nDissolved inorganic nitrogen, nitrate & ammonia\nDissolved oxygen & oxygen saturation percentage\nDissolved Inorganic (Carbon, Nitrogen & Phosphorus)\nDissolved Organic (Carbon, Nitrogen & Phosphorus)\nParticulate inorganic phosphorus & particulate inorganic\n\n\n\nWater quality measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal chlorophyll, dissolved inorganic nitrogen & total suspended solids\nTotal Suspended Solids, dust, mud carbonate & mud mineral\nSecchi depth, vertical attenuation at 490nm & light intensity above seagrass\nSimulated true colour\n\n\n\nMacroalgae, seagrass and coral\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoral symbiont (nitrogen & chlorophyll) & coral host nitrogen\nNitrogen (macroalgae, seagrass zostera, seagrass halophila & deep seagrass)\n\n\n\nCatchment scenarios comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisolved inorganic nitrogen\nTotal Chlorophyll\nSecchi depth\nTotal suspended solids\nLight intensity above seagrass\n\n\n\n\nRefereneces\nSkerratt, J, Mongin, M, Baird, M, Wild-Allen, K, Robson, B, Schaffelke, B, Davies, C, Richardson, A, Margvelashvili, N, Soja-Wozniak, M, and Steven, A, 2019a, Simulated nutrient and plankton dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef (2011-2016), Journal of Marine Systems, vol. 192, pp. 51-74, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.12.006"

(2025). eReefs visualisation suite - pre rendered animations and maps (AIMS, Source: CSIRO) (Version 1). eAtlas. https://doi.org/10.26274/NHYW-4C74\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The near-real time GBR1 and GBR4 models (including hydro, river tracer and BGC) are currently paused at January 17th 2024 due to infrastructure damage from the recent flooding events around the Daintree River region (see here). These floods have damaged the real-time river temperature and flow sensors across surrounding catchments, and Queensland government is working to recover and restore these as quickly as possible. We will provide further updates when available.\n\n\n\nThis page shows the temperature, wind, salinity and ocean currents on the Great Barrier Reef based on the 4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model. This visualisation product is also available for the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model.\nThe combination of temperature, wind, salinity and current shows key hydrodynamic parameters of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nThe temperature is primarily driven by the seasons and mixing of the water by wind and ocean currents. If the temperature rises too high during summer months then it can cause corals to bleach. This can be see during the summer months of 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nWind is a key driver of surface water currents, mixing and waves. In winter months the wind typically blows north west. These winds are known as the trade winds as they are a predictable seasonal pattern. In summer months the winds typically drop (except for cyclones) reducing the cooling and mixing of the water, resulting in significant surface temperatures rises during the day, creating a “heart-beat” pattern in the temperature in the video (see the Temperature panel in the March 2017 video as an example). The wind also drives the direction of the flood plumes. The north west blowing trade winds typically push any flood plumes back onto the coast and northwards. When the wind occasionally blows offshore then the plumes are pushed further out.\nThe path of cyclones can be seen in the wind variable. This shows the asymmetrical shape of the cyclone as it approaches the coast, due to the friction of the land slowing the winds on the southern side of the cyclone.\nNote: The winds in this model come from the BOM ACCESS meteorological product. This wind model does not accurately capture peak intensity of the cyclone or its exact path. It tends to underestimate the peak wind speeds. This is partly due to the model showing hourly average wind speed.\n\n\n\nSalinity is a measure of the saltiness of the water. Fresh water outflow from the rivers caused by flooding and rain events lowers the salinity (appearing as red in the maps). The low salinity is a good approximation for where flood plume waters might be. During flood plumes if the wind is blowing offshore then it will push the plume off the coast more toward the reefs. 2011 was a particularly wet year during the summer months causing extensive plumes to drift over reefal areas. (See Feb 2011 Burdekin region salinity panel for runoff from major flooding).\nNote: In flood plumes nutrient and sediment runoff lead to the formation of green plume water which has small suspended particles coated in algae that travel much further then is predicted by looking at just the lowering of the salinity.\n\n\n\nThe ocean currents are driven by the wind, tides, and temperature and salinity gradients. In the visualisations the strength of the current is represented by colour and the arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data (as shown in the videos) it is possible to see the tidal currents causing the direction of the current to flip back and forth. This tidal current increases the mixing of the water causing sediment in inshore areas to be stirred up. In the daily and monthly visualisations most of the fluctuations of the tidal currents are averaged out, allowing some of the large scale current flow patterns to be seen.\nMany marine organisms (such as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and corals) are dispersed by ocean currents planktonic larvae that float from reef to reef.\n\n\n\n\nCyclones: Yasi (Feb 2011), Ita (April 2014), Nathan (March 2015), Debbi (March 2017),\nCoral bleaching from high temperature (March 2016, March 2017),\nFlood plumes with low salinity (Burdekin Jan 2011, Feb 2019).

These visualisations are produced from using currents calculated by the eReefs hydrodynamic model to drive a tracer transport model.\nFlood plumes deliver sediments and nutrients into the ocean, both of which can result in detrimental effects on seagrass and reef habitats.\nThe left most panel shows the near-surface salinity and the wind vectors. The salinity indicates how salty the water is and it is lowered by river run off and rainfall. Thus reduced salinity is a measure of the combined impact of all rivers combined. The wind is shown as arrows overlaid on the salinity. The wind pushes the flood plumes around and has a strong influence on where the plumes go. The other major influence is the impact of the rotation of the Earth on buoyant plumes. The other three panels each show the river tracers for five rivers each. We split up the rivers into multiple panels to limit the amount of overlap in their extent during large flooding events.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at any given location, associated with each river.\nThe lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant reduction in light.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the river tracer product tracks the concentration of river water. It does not track sediment or nutrient in the water. As a result, it should be used as a guide for the potential area that might be affected by flood water. The primary value of this product is that it attributes flood plume water to its source river allowing the extent of individual rivers to be understood.\nTo understand more about the actual nutrient and sediment levels refer to the eReefs BioGeoChemical (BGC) model as it directly represents sediment and nutrients from all processes including wind resuspension and biological processes. In the BGC model however, it is not possible to directly attribute components of the sediment and nutrients concentrations to their source rivers.\nThis visualisation only shows the 15 largest rivers (based on largest historical flow) and so does not fully represent all the flood plumes. The salinity product can be used to see other rivers modelled by eReefs that are not explicitly separated out using the river tracer visualisation product.\nThe rivers shown in the visualisation were adjusted in their concentration threshold to represent the full flow of water associated with their river basin. In some catchments there are multiple rivers flowing into the ocean and eReefs represents this whole basin with a single river. As a result, the shape of the flood plume close to the coast may not be representative.\nAs part of the research into determining a suitable river concentration threshold to visualise we undertook many comparisons between the estimated flood plume extent from eReefs and those visible in Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. From this we found that the plume extent from eReefs was generally accurate to within about 10 km, with the most likely reason for the difference being slight errors in the model due to wind. The strength and direction of the wind is the predominant factor in determining the spread of the flood plumes. As a result any small errors in the modelling of the wind will lead to errors in the flood plume boundaries. The eReefs hydrodynamic model is driven by wind data from the Bureau of Meteorology’s Access-R weather model, which is a forecast. It has a resolution of 12 km and so it is surprising that the eReefs model is as spatially accurate as it is. Part of the reason for this is that while the wind occasionally pushes the plumes offshore, the main determinant of the distribution is the dynamics of buoyant plumes. The rotation of the Earth acts to deflect to the left (in the Southern Hemisphere) any relative increase in motion between fluid layers. One such relative motion is a buoyant plume flowing over the top of denser ocean water. Deflected left on a river discharging along an east coast means it being push towards the coast. Thus, the plumes are trapped near the coast. The distance to which they spread from the coast is also set by this balance between density driven flow and the Earth’s rotation, something ocean models are very good at.\n\n\nBaird, M. E., J.

    "text": "About the eReefs models\nThe eReefs hydrodynamic model predicts the movement of marine waters, as well as key physical environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity. This model is a deterministic physics based model that evolves based on equations of conversation of momentum, continuity and conservation of heat and salt driven externally by wind, atmospheric pressure gradients, surface heat and water fluxes and open-boundary conditions such as tides and low frequency ocean currents. The external boundary of CSIRO hydrodynamic model are forced by the BOM Access-R weather models and BOM OMAP for boundary currents. The GBR1 1 km model is nested inside the GBR4 4 km model, with the GBR4 acting as the boundary of the GBR1 model.\nThe hydrodynamic model results allow us to better understand the effect of cyclones, the location of potentially damaging heat waves that can cause coral bleaching, the ocean currents that disperse larve of corals and Crown-of-Thorns starfish, and fresh water plumes from flooded rivers that can damage inshore reefs.\nThe eReefs BioGeoChemical (BGC) and sediment model uses the results of the hydrodynamic model to track the movement and concentration of nutrients and sediments. It models the effects of land run off into the marine space and the nutrient recycling processes associated with plankton, seagrass and coral.\nMore information: eReefs: An operational information system for managing the Great Barrier Reef."

The raw model outputs are available publicly via the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI) THREDDS data service and are described in more detail on the Access to raw model output page on the CSIRO eReefs site. The problem is that using the raw model data directly can be a huge challenge due to their huge data size (~ 19 TB). The raw model data uses files that have a curvilinear grid, that helps the efficiency of the model, but prevents the data from being directly viewable in GIS applications such as QGIS or ArcGIS. Another significant challenge is that the model data has over 10's of millions of individual map layers making it very difficult to understand the processes looking at them one at a time. The AIMS eReefs platform aims to solve these problems by:\n\nPresenting visualisations using pre-rendered videos. These videos provide rapid viewing of the eReefs data. These videos show multiple related variables, to allow the connections between key processes to be easily seen,\nGenerating aggregations over time (daily, months, seasonal, annual) of the model data to show longer time scale spatial patterns of variables, whilst shrinking the data to a more manageable size,\nRegridding the model data from curvilinear data to a rectangular grid so that it can be used in a desktop GIS applications,\nProviding a data extraction service that allows time series data of locations of interest to be easily downloaded,\nProviding data services of all the generated derived data so that it can be accessed programmatically to facilitate reproducible science.\nGenerating exposures maps to identify regions where organisms are being exposed to harsh conditions that might adversely affect their health.\n\nThe products on this website are updated in near real time from the NCI data services.

The AIMS eReefs platform creates a local partial mirror of the data, stripping off unused variables to save on space. This data is then processed to produce regridded aggregation data with daily, monthly and annual aggregations. This data is made available as data services to allow data download, programmatic access to the data and as a web mapping service to link in with the CSIRO eReefs Vis Portal. The raw model data, along with the aggregated data is visualised as maps and map videos. These are made available via the AIMSeReefs visualisation portal.

(2025). eReefs visualisation suite - pre rendered animations and maps (AIMS, Source: CSIRO) (Version 1). eAtlas. https://doi.org/10.26274/NHYW-4C74\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The near-real time GBR1 and GBR4 models (including hydro, river tracer and BGC) are currently paused at January 17th 2024 due to infrastructure damage from the recent flooding events around the Daintree River region (see here). These floods have damaged the real-time river temperature and flow sensors across surrounding catchments, and Queensland government is working to recover and restore these as quickly as possible. We will provide further updates when available.\n\n\n\nThis page shows the temperature, wind, salinity and ocean currents on the Great Barrier Reef based on the 4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model. This visualisation product is also available for the 1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model.\nThe combination of temperature, wind, salinity and current shows key hydrodynamic parameters of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nThe temperature is primarily driven by the seasons and mixing of the water by wind and ocean currents. If the temperature rises too high during summer months then it can cause corals to bleach. This can be see during the summer months of 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nWind is a key driver of surface water currents, mixing and waves. In winter months the wind typically blows north west. These winds are known as the trade winds as they are a predictable seasonal pattern. In summer months the winds typically drop (except for cyclones) reducing the cooling and mixing of the water, resulting in significant surface temperatures rises during the day, creating a “heart-beat” pattern in the temperature in the video (see the Temperature panel in the March 2017 video as an example). The wind also drives the direction of the flood plumes. The north west blowing trade winds typically push any flood plumes back onto the coast and northwards. When the wind occasionally blows offshore then the plumes are pushed further out.\nThe path of cyclones can be seen in the wind variable. This shows the asymmetrical shape of the cyclone as it approaches the coast, due to the friction of the land slowing the winds on the southern side of the cyclone.\nNote: The winds in this model come from the BOM ACCESS meteorological product. This wind model does not accurately capture peak intensity of the cyclone or its exact path. It tends to underestimate the peak wind speeds. This is partly due to the model showing hourly average wind speed.\n\n\n\nSalinity is a measure of the saltiness of the water. Fresh water outflow from the rivers caused by flooding and rain events lowers the salinity (appearing as red in the maps). The low salinity is a good approximation for where flood plume waters might be. During flood plumes if the wind is blowing offshore then it will push the plume off the coast more toward the reefs. 2011 was a particularly wet year during the summer months causing extensive plumes to drift over reefal areas. (See Feb 2011 Burdekin region salinity panel for runoff from major flooding).\nNote: In flood plumes nutrient and sediment runoff lead to the formation of green plume water which has small suspended particles coated in algae that travel much further then is predicted by looking at just the lowering of the salinity.\n\n\n\nThe ocean currents are driven by the wind, tides, and temperature and salinity gradients. In the visualisations the strength of the current is represented by colour and the arrows represent the direction. In the hourly data (as shown in the videos) it is possible to see the tidal currents causing the direction of the current to flip back and forth. This tidal current increases the mixing of the water causing sediment in inshore areas to be stirred up. In the daily and monthly visualisations most of the fluctuations of the tidal currents are averaged out, allowing some of the large scale current flow patterns to be seen.\nMany marine organisms (such as Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and corals) are dispersed by ocean currents planktonic larvae that float from reef to reef.\n\n\n\n\nCyclones: Yasi (Feb 2011), Ita (April 2014), Nathan (March 2015), Debbi (March 2017),\nCoral bleaching from high temperature (March 2016, March 2017),\nFlood plumes with low salinity (Burdekin Jan 2011, Feb 2019).

Nitrogen is a key limiting nutrient in the growth of plants and algae. Coral reefs are generally nutrient poor environments with much of the nutrients being locally recycled. Increased nutrient levels promote the growth of phytoplankton, turf algae and macroalgae, inhibiting the rate of recovery of coral reefs.\nThe BGC model tracks the transformation of nitrogen through the nitrogen cycle, from fixing of nitrogen gas into ammonia by tricodesmium, to its uptake by plants, propagation through the food chain to zooplantkon, to release due to mortality and finally denitrification back into nitrogen gas.\nThe BGC model contains two forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved ammonia (NH4) and dissolved nitrate (NO3): DIN = [NH4] + [NO3]. In the model, the ammonia component of the DIN pool is assumed to be taken up first by all primary producers (phytoplankton, tricodesmium, macroalgae and seagrass), followed by the nitrate, with the caveat that the uptake of ammonia cannot exceed the diffusion limit for ammonia. The underlying principle of this assumption is that photosynthetic organisms can entirely preference ammonia, but that the uptake of ammonia is still limited by diffusion to the organism’s surface.\nNitrification is the oxidation of ammonia (NH4) with oxygen, to form nitrite followed by the rapid oxidation of these nitrites into nitrates (NO3). In the BGC model nitrification occurs in the water column and sediment depending on oxygen levels.\nPhotosynthetic growth is determined by concentrations of dissolved nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) and photosynthetically active radiation. Autotrophs (seagrass, phytoplankton, macroalgae and tricodesmium) take up dissolved ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and inorganic carbon. Ammonia is preferentially taken up as a source of nitrogen over nitrate as it can be directly used by plants. Nitrogen is transported through the phytoplankton to zooplankton food chain. Nitrogen is released as ammonia when an organism decays. Tricodesmium fixes nitrogen, converting nitrogen gas N2 into ammonia NH3 when the DIN concentration falls below a critical concentration.\n\n\nConcentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). DIN = [NH4] + [NO3].\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrate. In the absence of nitrite [NO2-] in the model, nitrate represents [NO3-] + [NO2-].\n\n\n\nConcentration of ammonia ions [NH4+].\n\n\n\nThe videos/images on this page are based on the 4km eReefs BioGeoChemical model (v3.1) (GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd) run with SOURCE Catchments using Baseline catchment conditions.

The main effect that can been seen in these visualisations is that the corals increase their chlorophyll density (and its corresponding nitrogen levels) during the winter months when the light levels are lower.\n\n\n\nThese visualisations show some of the internal dynamics of the coral modelling performed in the BGC. This model uses a 'single polyp' model that estimates the nutrient dynamics created by the coral in each grid cell of the model. This coral model helps the BGC to capture the nutrient dynamics caused by the uptake and release of nitrogen of corals as they grow and the effect they have on the PH of the water as they calcify their skeletons.\nThe BGC coral model and these matching visualisations should only be used as a guide for better understanding the BGC model and not as a reflection of the state of coral on the GBR. The BGC model does not include a detailed coral ecosystem model and thus does not provide an estimate of coral cover. It does not consider the effects of coral mortality caused by cyclones, disease or Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and so only provides a first approximation to how the coral reefs affect water chemistry.\nThis coral model is limited to coral reef areas (as determined by the GBRMPA reef features dataset), which is why there are only non-zero values over coral reef pixels. Additionally the model does not consider coral reefs in Torres Strait as these reefs were not included in the GBRMPA reef features dataset used to configure the model.\nNote: The visualisations for the monthly and yearly aggregations are based on regridded data (converting the original raw model data from a curvilinear grid to a regular rectangular grid). This process uses interpolation to perform the regridding process. Since this data is very discontinuous (zero everywhere, except for coral reef pixels) this interpolation results in visual anomalies around the boundaries of the reefs as the interpolation smooths the transition from the coral reef pixels to zero for open water.\n\n\n\nConcentration of nitrogen biomass per m2 of coral symbiont cells, or zooxanthellae. C:N:P is 106:16:1. Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.\n\n\n\nConcentration of chlorophyll biomass per m2 of coral symbiont cells. As chlorophyll is the only pigment resolved in the coral symbiont, ci represents the sum of the concentration of all photosynthetic pigments within the cell and has an absorption spectrum of divinyl chlorophyll a.

The BGC model cycles carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and oxygen through multiple phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus and dissolved organic and inorganic forms in the water column and sediment layers.\nThe production (by photosynthesis) and consumption (by respiration and remineralisation) of dissolved oxygen is included in the model and, depending on prevailing concentrations, facilitates or inhibits the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and its subsequent denitrification to dinitrogen gas which is then lost from the system.\nMore detail on how oxygen levels were modelled can be found in Baird et al. (2020).\n\n\n\nThe saturation state of oxygen [O2]sat is determined as a function of temperature and salinity following Weiss (1970). It represents the maximum amount of the dissolved oxygen that the water can hold. It is used to calculate the amount of oxygen exchange in the sea-air boundary. If the oxygen saturation percentage is below 100% then oxygen will be absorbed from the atmosphere. If it is above 100% then oxygen will be out gased from the sea into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nBaird, M. E., Wild-Allen, K.

The model estimates the optical properties of the water based on the sediment and nutrients in the water.

Coral polyps form this calcium carbonate by combining calcium (Ca2+) and carbonate (CO32-) ions in the seawater. This is achieved by the corals trapping small amounts of seawater, containing calcium ions (Ca2+), in small vesicles (small capsules) at the surface of the coral tissue. These vesicles slowly migrate through the coral tissue to its skeleton. On the way carbonate ions (CO32-) are then injected into these vesicles from the coral tissue, raising its concentration above surrounding seawater levels, helping to accelerate the carbonate precipitation (solid crystal formation). The biological process used to pump in the carbonate ions is not yet well understood. In the vesicles an amorphous (unstructured) calcium carbonate forms. Once the vesicles reach the surface of the skeleton the amorphous calcium carbonate particles attach to the skeleton and slowly transform into aragonite, which is the crystal structure of calcium carbonate that makes up the bulk of the coral skeleton (Mass et al., 2017).\nThe total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) in seawater is made up from the sum of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and carbonate ions (CO32-). The distribution of these carbon molecule species varies with the seawater pH. At a typical seawater pH of 8.1, bicarbonate dominates, representing around 90% of DIC. Carbonate ions (CO32-) are the next most abundant species (~10% of DIC), while carbon dioxide CO2(aq) represents less than 1% (Barker and Ridgwell, 2012). Increases in atmospheric CO2 results in more dissolved CO2 combining with water (H2O) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This lowers the pH of the water as the carbonic acid molecule splits into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). It is the free hydrogen ions (H+) that make it acidic. The existing carbonate ions (CO32-) in the water buffer the pH by combining with the extra hydrogen ions (H+) to form bicarbonate (HCO3-). As a result, increasing CO2 levels lowers the seawater pH, which in turn lowers the amount of carbonate in the seawater, which can impede calcification. While the CSIRO eReefs BioGeoChemical (BCG) model assumes a constant atmospheric CO2 level (and as such doesn't model increasing CO2 levels) understanding this causal change is useful to understanding how pH and total alkalinity (HCO3-+CO32-) are related.\nSurface seawater is generally supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate minerals, meaning that the concentration of calcium and carbonate ions is higher than the concentration needed for precipitation to occur. The aragonite saturation state is commonly used to track ocean acidification because it is a measure of carbonate ion concentration. Aragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and is widely used by marine calcifiers to build their skeletons and shells. Corals and other calcifiers are more likely to survive and reproduce when the saturation state is greater than three. When aragonite saturation state falls below 3, these organisms become stressed, and when saturation state is less than 1, shells and other aragonite structures begin to dissolve (NOAA, n.d.).\n\n\nThese maps show estimates, based on the eReefs BioGeoChemical model, of key variables that relate to ocean acidity and a metric (aragonite saturation state) that measures how easy it is for calcium carbonate (which makes up shells and coral skeletons) to precipitate (solidify) or dissolve.\nIn these visualisations we can see that the pH goes through a seasonal cycle with a lower pH in summer due to higher temperatures. The pH and aragonite saturation state is often lower near the coast. This is most likely due to plankton growth, which removes DIC from the water as it is converted to biological forms of carbon. This lowers the DIC, which in turn lowers the aragonite saturation state and pH.\n\n\n\nThe version of the BGC model here assumes a constant value for atmospheric CO2 of 396.4 ppm, see page 101 of Baird (2019). It is therefore not suitable for looking at trends in changes due to ocean acidification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentration of ions that can be converted to uncharged species by a strong acid. The model assumes total alkalinity is the sum of the bicarbonate and carbonate ions (AT =[HCO3-] + [CO32-]), often referred to as carbonate alkalinity. Alkalinity and DIC together quantify the equilibrium state of the seawater carbon chemistry.\n\n\n\npH based on [H+] calculated from carbon chemistry equilibra at water column values of temperature (T), salinity (S), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (AT).\n\n\n\nThe aragonite saturation state of seawater is the product of the concentrations of dissolved calcium and carbonate ions in seawater divided by their product at equilibrium: ( [Ca2+] × [CO32-] ) / [CaCO3], where dissolved calcium [Ca2+] is the seawater concentration of dissolved calcium ions, [CO32-] is the seawater concentration of carbonate ions and [CaCO3] is the solubility of aragonite in seawater. When the aragonite saturation state is 1, the seawater is exactly in equilibrium or saturation with respect to aragonite and as a result aragonite does not dissolve or precipitate.\nIn the BGC model coral growth is halted for aragonite saturation state values less than 2. The aragonite saturation state value determines the coral calcification rate in the model, where calcification is proportional to the amount that the aragonite saturation state value is above 1 and the carbon reserves of the coral.\n\n\n\n\nBaird, M.

Photosynthetic growth is determined by concentrations of dissolved nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) and available light.\nThe BGC model simulates the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen across multiple compartments—such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic and inorganic substances—distributed over various water column and sediment layers. The model conservatively tracks these nutrient flows based on mechanistic equations.\nThe ratio of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the organisms in the models is modelled as structural material with a Redfield ratio (O:C:N:P of 110:106:16:1 for plankton and animals; 554:550:30:1 for benthic plants) and a reserve within each organism. Growth is restricted by the limiting nutrient and light.\nMore details about how DIN, DIC, and DIP are calculated in the model can be found in Baird et al. (2020)\n\n\nNitrogen is critical for the plant and animal growth. It is needed for protein synthesis, DNA and RNA, and a major component in the development of chlorophyll needed for photosynthesis. Nitrogen is cycled through organisms but is eventually converted back into nitrogen gas. In the sediment nitrogen in the porewaters is denitrified and lost as nitrogen gas.\nWithin the GBR lagoon the main source of DIN is from land run off during flooding events. These flood plumes are generally stay close to the coast, pushed northwards by the wind. The nitrogen in the plumes leads to rapid growth of phytoplankton. This algal rich water absorbs light leading to less light reaching the seagrass meadows and inshore coral reefs (See Secchi depth, vertical attenuation at 490nm & light intensity above seagrass product) lowering their growth.\nIn the Coral Sea the nitrogen levels in the surface waters of the ocean are generally very low as it is quickly taken up by the growth of phytoplankton. As these plankton die their detritus slowly sink and the nitrogen is released back into deeper waters. Westward ocean currents coming from the Coral Sea divide north of Cairns, leading to northern (Gulf of Papua Current) and southern currents (East Australian Current). These flow along the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef and the continental shelf. On the outer edge of the ribbon reefs on the eastern side of Torres Strait and on the outer edge of the southern GBR these currents result in significant upwelling, drawing up nitrogen rich deeper water closer to the surface. This results in increased concentrations of DIN in these regions.\n\n\nThis visualisation shows the modelled Concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in mg N m-3. DIN is the sum of nitrate and ammonium concentrations, [NO3]+[NH4].\nThe model contains two forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) used by photosynthetic organisms, dissolved ammonium (NH4) and dissolved nitrate (NO3). In the model, the ammonium component of the DIN pool is taken up first, followed by the nitrate, with the caveat that the uptake of ammonium is limited by diffusion.\nFor nitrogen the main sources are river inputs, the atmosphere by nitrogen fixing Trichodesmium cyanobacteria and from upwelling of deeper nutrient rich waters. Nitrogen fixation (conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonium) occurs by trichodesmium algae when DIN is low (4 to 20 mg N m−3; Robson et al., 2013) and carbon and phosphorus are available to support nitrogen uptake.\nAn assessment of the BGC model shows it has a skill of (bias ± Root Mean Square Error) of nitrate of −0.70±3.86 mg N m−3 and ammonium of −0.77±1.63 mg N m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020). This represents the difference between the model values and 36 long-term water quality monitoring sites along the Queensland coast.\n\n\n\n\nDissolved Inorganic Phosphorus is used for various biological functions including ATP synthesis and DNA. In the BGC model DIP is needed for growth of marine phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, trichodesmium, seagrass, coral and macroalgae. Zooplankton receive their phosphorus from consuming phytoplankton. As organisms die, they become detritus and the phosphorus is liberated as DIP. DIP converts to and from Particulate Inorganic Phosphorus (PIP) at a rate dependant on the level of oxygen. A proportion of the phosphorus is adsorbed into the sediment and is permanently immobilised.\nThe phosphorus cycle is different to the nitrogen cycle as there is no exchange with the atmosphere. The final sink for phosphorus is the ocean sediment. The deeper ocean floor sediment is rich in phosphorus. Upwelling from the Coral Sea brings up nutrient-rich waters along the edge of the continental shelf.\n\n\nThis visualisation shows the modelled concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), also referred to as orthophosphate or soluble reactive phosphorus, SRP, composed chiefly of HPO42- ions, with a small percentage present as PO43-.\nAssessment of the predicted DIP indicates that the model has a skill of (bias ± RMSE) of -0.88 ± 2.17 mg P m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020). This is an assessment of the model against the AIMS long term water quality monitoring sites.\n\n\n\n\nThe major pools of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species in the ocean are HCO3-, CO3-, and dissolved CO2, which influence the speciation of H+ and OH− ions, and therefore pH.\nThe change in the surface DIC concentration is dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration, which is in turn determined from the DIC and the total alkalinity. At pH values around 8, dissolved CO2 makes up only approximately 1∕200 of DIC in seawater.\nIn the water column DIC is up taken by phytoplankton as part of photosynthesis and released as part of respiration.\n\n\nThe model contains two state variables to represent the state of carbon chemistry, dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity, which when combined with temperature and salinity allow the pH and aragonite saturation state to be calculated.\nAssessment of carbon chemistry properties along the entire length of the GBR shows a bias ± RMSE of DIC of -7.7 ± 34.2 mmol m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nBaird, M.

The “Baseline scenario” panel shows the best estimate for Total Suspended Solids for the time period from December 2010 to April 2019.\nThe “Pre-industrial” panel shows the difference between the baseline scenario and pre-industrial conditions. Areas in blue correspond to locations where the pre-industrial values are estimated to be better than the current baseline (lower Total Suspended Solids in the pre-industrial past). Red areas correspond to areas where the pre-industrial conditions would have been worse (higher Total Suspended Solids) than the current baseline. As this plot compares the current conditions with estimated pre-industrial conditions the difference represents the anthropogenic influence on Total Suspended Solids on the GBR. It shows that current Total Suspended Solids levels in the marine environment are generally higher than pre-industrial conditions along most of the coastline and is elevated even more during flooding events. The biggest difference can be observed in the far north where higher levels of Total Suspended Solids relative to the current baseline reach across the full width of the GBR.\nThe “WQIP-Targets” panel shows the effects of the planned targets if they were achieved. The blue area indicates the amount of reduction relative to the current baseline. Red areas correspond to an increase of Total Suspended Solids relative to the current baseline. The comparison between the baseline and reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario shows that implementing the WQIP-Target measures to lower Total Suspended Solids concentration would result in lower concentration for most places along the coast, with the highes impact archived in the far north.\nThe “% River water in sea water” panel shows the total percentage of river water in sea water. It can be used to identify significant river discharges and flood plumes which can have a big impact on the Total Suspended Solids concentration.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Brodie et al. conducted a study utilising the eReefs 4 km coupled hydrodynamic - biogeochemical model and two GBR Dynamic SedNet catchment model scenarios to analyse the water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Brodie et al., 2017). The complex eReefs biogeochemical model allowed for the resolution of biogeochemical processes affecting water quality changes. The main objective was to identify specific load reduction targets for different basins within the GBR, aiming to minimize ecological impacts related to chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations, as well as bottom light thresholds.\nIn 2020 Baird et al. built upon the previous study and expanded it by extending the time period from 2011–2014 to 2011–2018 and analysing the water quality response of a new set of catchment loads scenarios (Baird et al., 2021). These new scenario runs used the updated eReefs coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model with the model configuration GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3x_Dhnd. H2p0 is the configuration of the hydrodynamic model and has been operational since 2016. B3p1 is the configuration of the biogeochemical model, described in Baird et al. (2020). Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state. It uses the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (P2R) GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019) and Empirical SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses a configuration to simulate pre-industrial conditions and shows the change in water quality measures from the removal of all anthropogenic loads. P2R GBR Dynamic SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019), Empirical SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition (q3b) with anthropogenic loads (q3b - q3p) reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) 2017–2022 as calculated in Brodie et al. (2017). Further, the reductions are adjusted to account for the cumulative reductions already achieved between 2014 and 2019 that will be reflected in the 2019 catchment condition used in q3b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the sum of the suspended sediments in the water column. It is [Fine sediment] + [Mud] + [Mud carbonate] + [Mud mineral] + [Dust]. Total suspended solids is measured in mg/l and the variable representing it is EFI - Ecology Fine Inorganics.\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference of total suspended solids in mg/l between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.\nEFI_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) EFI - baseline (q3b) EFI\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference total suspended solids in mg/l between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.\nEFI_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) EFI - baseline (q3b) EFI\n\n\n\nThe GBR4 river tracer model output represents the river water concentration in sea water for the major rivers along the Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The “all_rivers” product aggregates the output for each river into one variable to represent the total concentration of river water in the sea water.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at any given location, associated with each river.\nThe lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant reduction in light.\nSee Flood plume extents for major rivers on GBR based on modelled river tracers for more information.\n\n\n\n\nBrodie, J., Baird, M., Mongin, M., Skerratt, J., Robillot, C., Waterhouse, J., 2017.

    "text": "These maps compare the estimated current state of the GBR (baseline) with pre-industrial and water quality target conditions (see eReefs BGC Scenarios for more information). The “Baseline scenario” panel shows the best estimate for Total Suspended Solids for the time period from December 2010 to April 2019.\nThe “Pre-industrial” panel shows the difference between the baseline scenario and pre-industrial conditions. Areas in blue correspond to locations where the pre-industrial values are estimated to be better than the current baseline (lower Total Suspended Solids in the pre-industrial past). Red areas correspond to areas where the pre-industrial conditions would have been worse (higher Total Suspended Solids) than the current baseline. As this plot compares the current conditions with estimated pre-industrial conditions the difference represents the anthropogenic influence on Total Suspended Solids on the GBR. It shows that current Total Suspended Solids levels in the marine environment are generally higher than pre-industrial conditions along most of the coastline and is elevated even more during flooding events. The biggest difference can be observed in the far north where higher levels of Total Suspended Solids relative to the current baseline reach across the full width of the GBR.\nThe “WQIP-Targets” panel shows the effects of the planned targets if they were achieved. The blue area indicates the amount of reduction relative to the current baseline. Red areas correspond to an increase of Total Suspended Solids relative to the current baseline. The comparison between the baseline and reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario shows that implementing the WQIP-Target measures to lower Total Suspended Solids concentration would result in lower concentration for most places along the coast, with the highes impact archived in the far north.\nThe “% River water in sea water” panel shows the total percentage of river water in sea water. It can be used to identify significant river discharges and flood plumes which can have a big impact on the Total Suspended Solids concentration."

The complex eReefs biogeochemical model allowed for the resolution of biogeochemical processes affecting water quality changes. The main objective was to identify specific load reduction targets for different basins within the GBR, aiming to minimize ecological impacts related to chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations, as well as bottom light thresholds.\nIn 2020 Baird et al. built upon the previous study and expanded it by extending the time period from 2011–2014 to 2011–2018 and analysing the water quality response of a new set of catchment loads scenarios (Baird et al., 2021). These new scenario runs used the updated eReefs coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model with the model configuration GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3x_Dhnd. H2p0 is the configuration of the hydrodynamic model and has been operational since 2016. B3p1 is the configuration of the biogeochemical model, described in Baird et al. (2020). Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state. It uses the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (P2R) GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019) and Empirical SedNet with 2019 catchment condition from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses a configuration to simulate pre-industrial conditions and shows the change in water quality measures from the removal of all anthropogenic loads. P2R GBR Dynamic SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019), Empirical SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition (q3b) with anthropogenic loads (q3b - q3p) reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) 2017–2022 as calculated in Brodie et al. (2017). Further, the reductions are adjusted to account for the cumulative reductions already achieved between 2014 and 2019 that will be reflected in the 2019 catchment condition used in q3b."

Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state.

The “Baseline scenario” panel shows the best estimate for Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) for the time period from December 2010 to April 2019.\nThe “Pre-industrial” panel shows the difference between the baseline scenario and pre-industrial conditions. Areas in blue correspond to locations where the pre-industrial values are estimated to be better than the current baseline (lower DIN in the pre-industrial past). Red areas correspond to areas where the pre-industrial conditions would have been worse (higher DIN) than the current baseline. As this plot compares the current conditions with estimated pre-industrial conditions the difference represents the anthropogenic influence on DIN on the GBR. It shows that current DIN levels in the marine environment are higher than pre-industrial conditions along most of the coastline and is elevated most during flooding events. The raised DIN extends out to the mid-shelf reefs, particularly along the reefs north of Townsville where the width of the GBR is narrower.\nThe “WQIP-Targets” panel shows the effects of the planned targets if they were achieved. The blue area indicates the amount of reduction of DIN relative to the current baseline. Red areas correspond to an increase of DIN relative to the current baseline. The comparison between the baseline and reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario shows that implementing the measures to lower DIN concentration would actually result in a reduced DIN concentration along most of the coast, with the exception of the Broad Sound area where it shows mostly positive values.\nThe “% River water in sea water” panel shows the total percentage of river water in sea water. It can be used to identify significant river discharges and flood plumes which can have a big impact on the DIN concentration.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Brodie et al. conducted a study utilising the eReefs 4 km coupled hydrodynamic - biogeochemical model and two GBR Dynamic SedNet catchment model scenarios to analyse the water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Brodie et al., 2017). The complex eReefs biogeochemical model allowed for the resolution of biogeochemical processes affecting water quality changes. The main objective was to identify specific load reduction targets for different basins within the GBR, aiming to minimize ecological impacts related to chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations, as well as bottom light thresholds.\nIn 2020 Baird et al. built upon the previous study and expanded it by extending the time period from 2011–2014 to 2011–2018 and analysing the water quality response of a new set of catchment loads scenarios (Baird et al., 2021). These new scenario runs used the updated eReefs coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model with the model configuration GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3x_Dhnd. H2p0 is the configuration of the hydrodynamic model and has been operational since 2016. B3p1 is the configuration of the biogeochemical model, described in Baird et al. (2020). Cq3x refers to one of the catchment model configurations (q3x = q3b, q3p, q3O, q3R, q3A, q3B, q3C; see Baird et al., 2021, for more information) of the 2019 report card version of the GBR Dynamic SedNet used to deliver nutrient and sediment river loads. Dhnd describes the deployment of the model, in this case being a non-assimilating hindcast (Baird et al., 2021).\nFor this scenario comparison we focused on the model configurations q3b baseline, q3p pre-industrial, and q3R reduced loads (WQIP-Targets):\n\n\nThis scenario is used as the baseline representing the best estimate of the current state.

P2R GBR Dynamic SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment condition from 1st of December 2010 to 30th of June 2018 (used for GBR Report Card published in 2019), Empirical SedNet with Pre-Industrial catchment from 1st of July 2018 to 30th of April 2019.\n\n\n\nThis scenario uses GBR Dynamic SedNet with 2019 catchment condition (q3b) with anthropogenic loads (q3b - q3p) reduced according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) 2017–2022 as calculated in Brodie et al. (2017). Further, the reductions are adjusted to account for the cumulative reductions already achieved between 2014 and 2019 that will be reflected in the 2019 catchment condition used in q3b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentration of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN). DIN = [NH4] + [NO3].\nWithin the GBR lagoon the main source of DIN is from land run off during flooding events. These flood plumes generally stay close to the coast, pushed northwards by the wind. The nitrogen in the plumes leads to rapid growth of phytoplankton. This algal rich water absorbs light leading to less light reaching the seagrass meadows and inshore coral reefs (see Secchi depth, vertical attenuation at 490nm & light intensity above seagrass product) lowering their growth.\n\n\nThis visualisation shows the modelled concentration of DIN in mg N m-3. DIN is the sum of nitrate and ammonium concentrations, [NO3]+[NH4].\nThe model contains two forms of DIN used by photosynthetic organisms, dissolved ammonium (NH4) and dissolved nitrate (NO3). In the model, the ammonium component of the DIN pool is taken up first, followed by the nitrate, with the caveat that the uptake of ammonium is limited by diffusion.\nFor nitrogen the main sources are river inputs, the atmosphere by nitrogen fixing Trichodesmium cyanobacteria and from upwelling of deeper nutrient rich waters. Nitrogen fixation (conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonium) occurs by trichodesmium algae when DIN is low (4 to 20 mg N m−3; Robson et al., 2013) and carbon and phosphorus are available to support nitrogen uptake.\nAn assessment of the BGC model shows it has a skill of (bias ± Root Mean Square Error) of nitrate of −0.70±3.86 mg N m−3 and ammonium of −0.77±1.63 mg N m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020). This represents the difference between the model values and 36 long-term water quality monitoring sites along the Queensland coast.\n\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic contribution.\nDIN_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.\nDIN_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN\n\n\n\nThe GBR4 river tracer model output represents the river water concentration in sea water for the major rivers along the Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The “all_rivers” product aggregates the output for each river into one variable to represent the total concentration of river water in the sea water.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river.

Nitrogen fixation (conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonium) occurs by trichodesmium algae when DIN is low (4 to 20 mg N m−3; Robson et al., 2013) and carbon and phosphorus are available to support nitrogen uptake.\nAn assessment of the BGC model shows it has a skill of (bias ± Root Mean Square Error) of nitrate of −0.70±3.86 mg N m−3 and ammonium of −0.77±1.63 mg N m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020). This represents the difference between the model values and 36 long-term water quality monitoring sites along the Queensland coast.\n\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic contribution.\nDIN_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN\n\n\n\nThis variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.\nDIN_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN\n\n\n\nThe GBR4 river tracer model output represents the river water concentration in sea water for the major rivers along the Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The “all_rivers” product aggregates the output for each river into one variable to represent the total concentration of river water in the sea water.\nIn the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at any given location, associated with each river.\nThe lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant reduction in light.\nSee Flood plume extents for major rivers on GBR based on modelled river tracers for more information."

These files can be downloaded from the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server (for more information on how to download the files see the tutorial How to manually download derived data from THREDDS). Once downloaded, the files can be visualised and analysed using common GIS tools like ArcMap and QGIS.\nNote: This tutorial refers only to the NetCDF files produced by the AIMS eReefs system (AIMS eReefs derived data) and not the raw eReefs data produced by CSIRO (available on the NCI THREDDS server). This is due to the usage of a curvilinear grid in the raw eReefs data which is better suited to the modelling and execution requirements than a rectilinear grid. However curvilinear grids are incompatible with many off-the-shelf GIS software packages (including ArcMap and QGIS) and can be cumbersome to process with typical data science tools. Therefore, all eReefs derived datasets generated by the AIMS eReefs system have been regridded to a rectilinear grid."
