This page shows the daily minimum, maximum and temperature range on the Great Barrier Reef based on the [4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/). This is an experimental product that is intended to help investigate whether daily temperature range is a useful indicator of resistence to coral bleaching.
