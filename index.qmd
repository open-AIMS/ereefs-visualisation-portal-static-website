In this portal you will find a range of visualisations of the eReefs
Hydrodynamic and BioGeoChemical models of the Great Barrier Reef. These models
are like weather models, but for the marine environment, providing a picture of
the current and historical environmental conditions on the Great Barrier Reef.
Here you can see past extreme weather events such as:

- Cyclones: [**Yasi** (Feb 2011)](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2011;month=2), [**Ita** (April 2014)](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2014;month=4), [**Nathan** (March 2015)](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2015;month=3), [**Debbi** (March 2017)](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2017;month=3),
- Coral bleaching from high temperature ([March 2016](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2016;month=3), [March 2017](./gbr4/temp-wind-salt-current/index.qmd#year=2017;month=3)),
- Flood plumes with low salinity ([North Queensland Flooding 2019](./gbr1/salt-multi-depth/index.qmd#region=townsville-3;year=2019;month=2), [Burdekin Jan 2011](./gbr1/salt-multi-depth/index.qmd#year=2011;month=1;region=townsville-3))

This site provides both direct visualisations of the outputs of the eReefs
Hydrodynamic and BioGeoChemical models and aggregations of the hourly and daily
data to longer time periods (monthly and annual).

## eReefs CSIRO Hydrodynamic Model

The [eReefs hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-hydrodynamics/) predicts the movement of water and key
environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, currents, tides). This model
allows us to better understand how cyclones mix the water, the location of
potentially damaging heat waves, the ocean currents that disperse larvae of
corals and Crown-of-Thorns starfish, and fresh water plumes from flooded rivers
that can damage inshore reefs.

This model is run with a 4 km and 1 km grid size. The 4 km grid has a longer
hindcast going back to September 2010, while the 1 km model starts in December
2014. The 1 km model also only extends out to the edge of the Great Barrier
Reef, whereas the 4 km model covers much of the Coral Sea. The hydrodynamic
model and visualisations are normally updated in near-real time, within 1 week
of the current date.

Note: The eReefs models are currently not being run in near-real time by CSIRO
as a result this site only shows the back catalogue up to mid 2020. Near
realtime results are expected to be back in operation by the end of 2020.

## eReefs CSIRO BioGeoChemical model (4&nbsp;km)

The [GBR4 BioGeoChemical (GBR) model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-biogeochemistry/) builds on the GBR4 hydrodynamic model by
modelling the water quality (nutrients and [suspended sediment](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-sediment-transport/)) and key
ecological processes (coral, seagrass, plankton) that drive the water
chemistry. This model allows us to better understand how water quality is
affected by land runoff. Detailed information about the model can be found in
the paper: [CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS): Scientific description of
the optical and biogeochemical models (vB3p0)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-115).

The visualisations on this site are based on version 3.1 of the BioGeoChemical
(BGC) model with the baseline conditions. Version 3.1 of the BGC was developed
to compare the effects of land practice improvements on water quality changes
in the Great Barrier Reef. It was run with three scenarios of river sediment
and nutrient loads to simulate the differences between baseline conditions
(based on current land use practices in 2019), pre-industrial catchment
conditions, and target catchment conditions (anthropogenic loads reduced
according to the percentage reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the
[Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022](https://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/46115/reef-2050-water-quality-improvement-plan-2017-22.pdf)). This site currently only
visualises the baseline scenario run of the model, however data is available
for the other scenarios via the [NCI THREDDS service](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalogs/fx3/catalog.html) (raw model data in
curvilinear NetCDF format), the [AIMS Data Extraction tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/?_gl=1*1h5mq5j*_ga*OTM5OTM3MTMzLjE2NjczNTcwNzg.*_ga_6SSTNBNHXG*MTY5NDQ4MTU0NS42Ni4xLjE2OTQ0ODc3NzkuMC4wLjA.) (time series
extraction in CSV format) and regridded and aggregated format via the [AIMS
eReefs THREDDS service](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html).

A [technical assessment of the skill level of the BGC version 3.1 model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2020/08/Reanalysis_v1_August2020.pdf) shows
that the absolute accuracy of the BGC model varies significantly with variable
and location. A older analysis on the BGC version 2.0 ([Skerratt et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.12.006))
provides additional background on the skill of the BGC model. As a result care
should be taken to ensure the model is fit-for-purpose and in general BGC
results should used in combination with second sources of information for
making recommendations.
