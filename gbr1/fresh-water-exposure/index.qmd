This page shows as estimate of exposure to fresh water on the Great
Barrier Reef based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic
model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/).

### Coral Exposure to Fresh Water

When corals are stressed by changes in conditions (such as salinity or
temperature), they can expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues
(zooxanthellae), causing them to turn completely white (bleach).
Prolonged or frequent bleaching events can result in coral death. This
product aims to provide an estimate of exposure to fresh water over the
aggregation period (eg: a calendar month). Predicting the level of coral
bleaching from freshwater exposure is difficult due to uncertainties in
the hydrodynamic modelling and the relatively poor understanding of
freshwater exposure. This product calculates fresh water exposure as the
number of hours over the aggregation period when salinity is below an
environmentally significant threshold (26 and 28 PSU are used in the
above images, which represent significantly more fresh than sea water).
Based on the few observations available, areas in these maps with an
exposure of greater than 50 PSU days (such as occurred around [North
Queensland Floods in 2019](#region=townsville-3;year=2019;month=2)) are
likely to have experienced coral mortality. In years where there has
been minimal flooding the fresh water exposure map is largely blank.

## Background

The salinity of normal ocean water is approximately 35 PSU. As
freshwater is mixed with the sea water the salinity drops, with pure
water having a PSU of zero. Coral reefs are sensitive to freshwater as
exposure can lead to bleaching and death. The relationship between
freshwater exposure and coral bleaching and mortality is poorly
understood. However flooding from Fitzroy river in 2011 cause
significant shallow water coral mortality on the nearby Keppel Islands
(Berkelmans et al. 2012).

## Average salinity

The third panel in the map shows the average salinity for the month.
This is quite similar to the freshwater exposure except that is includes
contributions from areas where there was very little freshwater.

## Freshwater exposure calculations

The freshwater exposure maps show the level of exposure to salinity
levels below a specified threshold over a month. In the maps above the
freshwater exposure was calculated for two threshold levels: 26 and 28
PSU. These were chosen as different species have different tolerances to
freshwater exposure, and the most appropriate level is not currently
known.

The freshwater exposure is calculated from the sum of the daily average
salinity below the exposure threshold. Salinity levels above the
threshold don\'t contribute at all to the exposure. Salinity levels
below the threshold contribute in proportion to the amount below the
threshold. As a result with a threshold of 28 PSU and an exposure to 22
PSU for 3 days the freshwater exposure would be (28-22)\*3 = 18 PSU
days. The same exposure at 25 PSU would take 6 days (28-25)\*6 = 18 PSU
days. This method of calculating exposure is conceptually very similar
to temperature exposure measured in Degree Heating Weeks, where the
higher the temperature is above the typical maximum summer temperature
the faster the heat stress occurs. For freshwater exposure the stress
occurs when the salinity drops below the threshold value. The lower the
salinity the faster the exposure accumulates. More research is needed to
determine if this is the best method for estimating stress from
freshwater.

For comparison the freshwater exposure calculations were applied to the
observations taken during the Fitzroy flooding event in 2011 that caused
significant coral mortality on reef flats corals in the Keppel Islands
(Berkelmans et al. 2012). This shows that exposure to greater than **50
PSU days can result in significant mortality**, particularly in
sensitive coral species.

## How accurate is the modelled freshwater exposure?

The results on this page are generated from a model and not based on
direct measurements of the salinity. It is difficult to reliably
determine the level of error without direct measures of salinity during
the event, however there are a few clues that give us some estimate of
the error and confidence in the results. @fig-fresh-water-comparison shows a comparison
between the freshwater exposure calculated from the 1 km and 4 km eReefs
hydrodynamic models (v2.0). This shows there is a significant difference
between these models. For a threshold of 28 PSU at Magnetic Island the 1
km model shows freshwater exposure of 35 PSU days, where as the 4 km
model shows 0 PSU days.

@fig-fresh-water-comparison shows a comparison between the freshwater exposure <!-- This reference only works in the prerelease 28/09/2023 -->
calculated for February 2019 from the 4 km and 1 km eReefs hydrodynamic
model (v2.0) with a threshold of 28 PSU. The 4 km model predicts a
smaller freshwater plume.

<br>
Observations taken along the eastern side of Magnetic Island taken on
the 20th February 2019 showed no evidence of freshwater bleaching,
although some corals were pale due to low light conditions. Corals on
the rocks near AIMS (near the Haughton river) showed freshwater
mortality. These two points of reference can be used to gauge whether
the 1 km or 4 km results are more accurate.

Applying the previously estimated freshwater exposure 50 PSU days the 1
km model predicts there would be coral mortality at Cape Ferguson, which
was the case, where as the 4 km model predicts none. At Magnetic Island
both models predict no freshwater mortality and none was observed.

There is currently little evidence to assess the accuracy of freshwater
exposure maps, however the available evidence indicates that the 1 km
model are a better match to observations.
