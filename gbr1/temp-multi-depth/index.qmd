This page shows temperature at different depths on the Great Barrier Reef based
on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/).

# Temperature at different depths

This product highlights how the temperature varies with depth. The eReefs
Hydrodynamic model contains over 40 depth slices allowing us to see how the
water cools with depth and how cool water is mixed by extreme events such as
cyclones. Note that most of the Great Barrier Reef has a depth of less than 100
m, so as the depth is increased, less of the reef area is visible on the map.

The shallowest depth (2.35m) represents the surface temperature in the model.

The middle depth (18m) is useful for investigating whether corals not at the
surface were also subjected to high temperature conditions during bleaching
events. We can see in the [March 2016 video](#year=2016;month=3;region=torres-strait-3) that the high temperature
conditions leading to bleaching were also persistent at this depth.

The deeper water depth (49m) is useful for looking at the mixing effects of
cyclones. Slow moving cyclones build up circular ocean currents that can mix
the water down to 300 m. This can be seen with [Cyclone Nathan in March 2015](#year=2015;month=3).
