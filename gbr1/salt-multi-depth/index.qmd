This page shows salinity at different depths on the Great Barrier Reef
based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/).

### Salinity at different depths

The salinity of normal ocean water is approximately 35 PSU. As
freshwater is mixed with the ocean water the salinity drops, with pure
water having a PSU of zero. This product highlights that, absent forced
mixing from current upwelling (such as by cyclones), lower salinity
water floats to the surface (represented on this page by the 2.35m
depth).
