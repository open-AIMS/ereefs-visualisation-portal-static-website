This page shows the strength and direction of ocean currents at different
depths on the Great Barrier Reef based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/).
The strength of the current is represented by colour. The arrows represent the
direction. In the hourly data a lot of the daily fluctuations are due to tidal
currents. These tend to make the current direction swing back and forth as the
tides flow and and out of a region.
