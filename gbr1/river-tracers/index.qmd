This product shows flood plumes associated with the major rivers along the
Queensland coastline flowing into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These
visualisations are produced from using currents calculated by the eReefs
hydrodynamic model to drive a tracer transport model.

Flood plumes deliver sediments and nutrients into the ocean, both of which can
result in detrimental effects on seagrass and reef habitats.

The left most panel shows the near-surface salinity and the wind vectors. The
salinity indicates how salty the water is and it is lowered by river run off
and rainfall. Thus reduced salinity is a measure of the combined impact of all
rivers combined. The wind is shown as arrows overlaid on the salinity. The wind
pushes the flood plumes around and has a strong influence on where the plumes
go. The other major influence is the impact of the rotation of the Earth on
buoyant plumes. The other three panels each show the river tracers for five
rivers each. We split up the rivers into multiple panels to limit the amount of
overlap in their extent during large flooding events.

In the model, tracers are released at the mouth into the surface flow of each
river. These tracers move with the ocean currents, becoming more dilute as they
spread out and mix with the ocean water, allowing the concentration of river
water to be tracked over time. These tracers show the fraction of the water, at
any given location, associated with each river.

The lowest threshold of river water concentration (1%) shown in the
visualisation was chosen to align with the visible extent of flood plumes as
seen in satellite imagery. At this concentration we can expect organisms on the
sea floor to see raised nutrient levels, some fine sediment and a significant
reduction in light.

## Limitations and spatial accuracy

It should be noted that the river tracer product tracks the concentration of
river water. It does not track sediment or nutrient in the water. As a result,
it should be used as a guide for the potential area that might be affected by
flood water. The primary value of this product is that it attributes flood
plume water to its source river allowing the extent of individual rivers to be
understood.

To understand more about the actual nutrient and sediment levels refer to the
[eReefs BioGeoChemical (BGC) model](https://ereefs.aims.gov.au/ereefs-aims/gbr4/bgc/baseline/chl-a-sum_din_efi) as it directly represents sediment and
nutrients from all processes including wind resuspension and biological
processes. In the BGC model however, it is not possible to directly attribute
components of the sediment and nutrients concentrations to their source rivers.

This visualisation only shows the 15 largest rivers (based on largest
historical flow) and so does not fully represent all the flood plumes. The
salinity product can be used to see other rivers modelled by eReefs that are
not explicitly separated out using the river tracer visualisation product.

The rivers shown in the visualisation were adjusted in their concentration
threshold to represent the full flow of water associated with their river
basin. In some catchments there are multiple rivers flowing into the ocean and
eReefs represents this whole basin with a single river. As a result, the shape
of the flood plume close to the coast may not be representative.

As part of the research into determining a suitable river concentration
threshold to visualise we undertook many comparisons between the estimated
flood plume extent from eReefs and those visible in Sentinel 2 satellite
imagery. From this we found that the plume extent from eReefs was generally
accurate to within about 10 km, with the most likely reason for the difference
being slight errors in the model due to wind. The strength and direction of the
wind is the predominant factor in determining the spread of the flood plumes.
As a result any small errors in the modelling of the wind will lead to errors
in the flood plume boundaries. The eReefs hydrodynamic model is driven by wind
data from the Bureau of Meteorology's Access-R weather model, which is a
forecast. It has a resolution of 12 km and so it is surprising that the eReefs
model is as spatially accurate as it is. Part of the reason for this is that
while the wind occasionally pushes the plumes offshore, the main determinant of
the distribution is the dynamics of buoyant plumes. The rotation of the Earth
acts to deflect to the left (in the Southern Hemisphere) any relative increase
in motion between fluid layers. One such relative motion is a buoyant plume
flowing over the top of denser ocean water. Deflected left on a river
discharging along an east coast means it being push towards the coast. Thus,
the plumes are trapped near the coast. The distance to which they spread from
the coast is also set by this balance between density driven flow and the
Earthâ€™s rotation, something ocean models are very good at.
