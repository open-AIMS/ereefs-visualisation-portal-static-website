This page shows the magnitude of the surface sea water current on the Great
Barrier Reef based on the [1km eReefs Hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/).

The magnitude shown in these videos and images tells you the speed of the
water, but with no indication of the direction. In shallow areas this
information can be useful in understanding the amount of sediment mixing caused
by tides and the amount of shear stress (side ways rubbing) that these areas
might experience. Shallow areas that have a high current magnitude are likely
to be different habitats.

For details of this dataset and access to the data see the [eReefs CSIRO
Hydrodynamic model (Temperature, Salinity, Wind, Current) Summaries
(AIMS)](https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/375c9dc9-70f8-4d97-a3e9-c013896a81e5) metadata page.
